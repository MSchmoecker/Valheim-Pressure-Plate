### Plate settings
![config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MSchmoecker/Valheim-Pressure-Plate/master/Docs/ExampleGUI.png)

Press 'E' when hovering over a plate to open its setting:
- Trigger Radius: if a player is inside this range, the plate is pressed
- Door Radius: all doors inside this radius are opened/closed
- Activation Time: duration in which the plate is pressed
- Trigger Delay: duration it takes before the plate is pressed
- Invert Doors: inverts open/closed state
- Toggle Mode: the plate stays active after the first press and needs to be pressed again to deactivate
- Ignore wards: allows other players to open doors even they have no access
- Only open if not permitted: The plate only interacts with players that don't have permission inside the ward area. Requires 'Ignore wards' to be active
- Allow creatures to trigger: monster and creatures can also press the plate. Requires 'Ignore wards' to be active
- Tame interaction: decides what certain tame status is needed in order to interact with the plate. Requires both 'Ignore wards' and 'Allow creatures to trigger' to be active
